# Machine Learning A-Z Module
This project includes various ML techniques available.
In each ML technique follows a standard pre-processing that includes following steps:
1. Importing Datasets
2. Replace missing data appropriate valid data using MEAN and other operations
3. Encoding categorical data. Example encoding categories which involve strings as numbers.
4. Dummy encoding done for more than two categories. Inorder to remove the hierarchy that got created due to encoding.
5. If needed splitting datasets as training and testing datasets.
6. Feature Scaling is done for situations where the difference in values in one column with the same rows of other column is very high.

After preprocessing is done we follow below further steps to predict the output:
1. choose appropriate ML class for the respective ML technique.
2. Create a =n object and then fit the object to our dataset.
3. Then preidct the test set results using the model generated after fitting.
4. Evaluate the model using various performance metrics.
5. Then the visualise the test set results and analyse the output generated.
