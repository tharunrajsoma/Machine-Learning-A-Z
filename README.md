# Machine Learning A-Z Module
This project includes implementation of various ML techniques available.

In each ML technique I follow a standard pre-processing procedure that includes following steps:
1. Importing Datasets
2. Replace missing data with appropriate valid data using MEAN and other mathematical methods.
3. Encoding categorical data. For example, encoding the categories which involve strings as numbers.
4. Dummy encoding is done for datasets with more than two categories. Inorder to remove the invalid hierarchy that got created due to above encoding.
5. If needed splitting the datasets as training and testing datasets is done.
6. Feature Scaling is done for datasets in which the differences in values from one column to another column of the same row is very high.

After preprocessing is done I follow further steps given below to get right ML model:
1. Choose appropriate ML class for the respective ML technique.
2. Create an object for the class choosen and then fit the object to our dataset.
3. Then predict the test set results using the model generated by fitting object with the dataset.
5. Then the visualise the test set results and analyse the output generated.

NOTE: For each dataset choosen for a Machine Learning model, dataset and explanation is available in the respective ML technique folder.
